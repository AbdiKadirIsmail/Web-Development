Skills developed: Hand-eye coordination, communicating, organizing, planning and teamwork skills.   Duties: At the time at working at Graceland Solicitors I been doing mainly office work such as; <br>
printing, faxing, organizing files and running errands for fellow workers. I have also been learning the ways of a workplace and how it is like having a role with high workload as I had to organize hundreds of files alphabetically in a time-period so that they can find the information needed quickly.  However, my time there was great, as I get to see how a solicitor works first hand. It has helped me improve on how important everyone's role in a workplace is and to always work hard in any position. <br>

<br>Sporting Club Thamesmead, <br>
Location: Bayliss Avenue, Thamesmead, London, SE28 8NJ July 2016 Duration: 2 weeks.<br> 
Skills developed: Teamwork, Leadership, adaption and critical thinking skills.<br>
Duties: Working at Sporting Club Thamesmead was a very refreshing experience. This is because I was able to take part in various sports activities such as cycling, table tennis, football and much more. However, it wasn't only seeing the sports sessions held at Sporting Club Thamesmead. Our group also had to plan 2-day sessions for primary school kids in which we had to create multiple activities suitable for them. Including to try to teach each group the rules and lead them on to how to take part in the activity. It was a different experience as we had to lead others into doing jobs and pre-plan everything that would happen such as; the time, place, risks etc. This gave me an opportunity to see in the view of a managerial/boss perspective in a workplace and how difficult it can become, as anything can go wrong. Therefore, we must adapt to any situation which is the key skill I have developed. In addition to securing a fist aid qualification.<br>    
Reason for leaving: Reason for leaving: Only time given from full time student allocated to work experience in Sixth form, year 13 by the school.<br>
